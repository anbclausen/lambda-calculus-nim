# Lambda Calculus Interpreter, written in Nim
This is a personal project I'm doing for fun. I love Lambda Calculus and I'm very interested in Nim, a programming language I've recently discovered.

I will take a semi-functional approach to writing this interpreter.

Stay tuned!

## How to run
Navigate to the file in your terminal. Write the following to compile and run the interpreter.
```
nim c -r main.nim 
```

Of course you need to have Nim installed.
